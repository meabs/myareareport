## Data notes

- **Crime data** is published monthly by police forces — typically 2 months in arrears.
- **Flood data** is real-time from the Environment Agency monitoring API.
- **House price data** is from the Land Registry Price Paid dataset — typically 4-8 weeks in arrears. Queried via SPARQL by outcode (postcode district).
- **Traffic data** is from National Highways WebTRIS — monthly averages for motorway and A-road sensors. Some sites may not have data for the most recent month; the app falls back to 2 months prior automatically.
- Crime locations are **anonymised** (snapped to nearest street node) per Police UK licence.
- All data is licensed under the **Open Government Licence v3.0**.
- **Place name search**: entering a place name (e.g. "Chester") resolves to the nearest representative postcode. Data accuracy is best with a full postcode.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Postcode not found | Use full postcode with space, e.g. `SW1A 2AA` not `SW1A2AA` |
| Crime total is 0 | Police data lags ~2 months — app auto-selects latest available month |
| Flood stations not shown | Some areas don't have EA monitoring stations within 12km |
| Map tiles not loading | Check CSP — add `tile.openstreetmap.org` to `resourceDomains` |
| Model context not updating | Host may not support `updateModelContext` — try Claude Desktop |
